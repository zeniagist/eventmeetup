# Event Meetup App

Event Meetup App is a progressive web application built with React hosted by a serverless function with AWS using the test-driven development (TDD) approach. [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar) is implimented to fetch upcoming events.

Users can search for a city and view a list of events hosted in the selected city. The app also allows a user to view charts that display how many events will take place on certain days as well view the popularity of the event.
